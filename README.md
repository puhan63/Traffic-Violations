# Traffic-Violations

Montgomery County, Maryland, has compiled data on all electronic traffic violations issued within the county. This information includes specific details regarding the nature of the violation, as well as driver demographics such as gender and race.

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of this data to uncover critical insights that will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of law enforcement officers.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

**Trends Analysis**: Evaluation of number of searches and arrests conducted by police officers by year and time to day.
**Demographics Impact on Searches and Arrests** : Impact of Race and gender on the number of searches and arrests.
**Performance Analysis**: Is there a certain demographic that has higher likelihood of getting searched or arrested.

The MySQL Workbench quieries used for these inspections and validations are available here.
